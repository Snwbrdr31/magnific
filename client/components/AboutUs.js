                The Magnific management team has been in the display business for over 20 years. In 2010, it became
                the teams focus to develop a better retractable display system. In 2013, we launched a display line
                featuring the revolutionary magnetic loading system. This system simplifies the process of installing a
                graphic into the stand. It eliminates the fear of removing the pin prematurely and requiring the stand to
                be taken apart to fix the tension. Every stand is a cartridge system that allows anyone to easily
                interchange graphics. Multiple banners can be produced for use in one banner stand. With the simple
                turn of a key, tension can be applied to the stand. By pressing a button, the tension can be retracted.
                The magnetic loading system is versatile and most importantlyâ€¦simply simple.
